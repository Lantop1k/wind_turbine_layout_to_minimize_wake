Using particles swarm Optimization (PSO) for the optimal positioning of Wind Farm Layout for the reduction of wake loss

 Introduction
Due to the need to maintain consistent, environment-friendly, and economic power sources, wind power energy has become popular. A wind turbine is a mechanical device that converts wind kinetic energy into electrical energy.  Wind turbines are combined to produce in the wind farm to produce a larger amount of electrical energy.  The design of the placement of the individual wind turbine within the farm has been a major challenge in wind energy production. This project presents an optimization method using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) for the optimal design of farm layout for the optimization of power output.
